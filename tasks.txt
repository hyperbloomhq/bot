- fix bullshit re-fething wallets code I wrote in track-wallets.ts
- fix SOL price for some pump.fun sells, tried to fix it before but it stills buggy
- fix update events not working at all specially when changing bot status in settings command (done)
- exclude banned wallets from logs at runtime, there is a problem caused by the mess in update events (done)
